                In future, I hope to become a creative director, and development team lead for application development. I especially have an interest in games design. I plan to continue working with my partners at <span class="span">Sudo-Code Software</span>, at which we are currently working on a number of projects including a number of game ideas, as well as consumer apps.</p>
            <p class="content orange">
                Currently, my skill-set includes basic programming and design, which needs to improve, however I think that things like team management and communication ability are going to be even more necessary if I am to become a creative director.</p>
